summary: FERC directed PJM to submit tariff revisions by January 19, 2026 addressing co-located generation and load arrangements. The December 2025 order found PJM's current tariff "unjust and unreasonable" for lacking clear provisions on interconnection for customers serving co-located load, primarily data centers seeking behind-the-meter arrangements.

===MACRO_TRENDS===
**Nuclear renaissance accelerates.** Meta's 6.6 GW nuclear portfolio announcement—spanning existing plants (Vistra) and advanced reactors (Oklo, TerraPower)—signals that tech companies are moving beyond pilot projects to utility-scale nuclear procurement. Combined with DOE's $2.7 billion uranium enrichment investment, the domestic nuclear supply chain is receiving unprecedented support from both private and public sectors.

**Offshore wind faces legal gauntlet.** While three projects won injunctions to resume construction, two remain suspended and Vineyard Wind reports $2 million daily losses. The legal uncertainty creates a two-track industry: projects nearing completion may survive, but the permitting and legal risk premium for new developments has increased substantially.

**Grid investment responds to load growth.** EIA's forecast of the strongest four-year electricity demand growth since 2000 is driving transmission expansion across all RTOs. MISO's $22 billion Long-Range Plan, the newly operational New England Clean Energy Connect, and China's 40% grid investment surge all reflect the urgency of building infrastructure to meet data center and electrification loads.

===CALENDAR===

| Date | Event | Significance |
|------|-------|--------------|
| January 19, 2026 | PJM co-location tariff filing deadline | FERC-mandated compliance filing on data center interconnection rules |
| January 20, 2026 | PJM CIFP status report due | Informational report on expedited large load interconnection process |

===KEY_QUESTIONS===
- Will additional offshore wind projects secure injunctions before construction windows close, or will extended delays strand investments?
- How will PJM's co-location tariff revisions balance data center flexibility with grid reliability and cost allocation concerns?
- Can advanced reactor developers (Oklo, TerraPower) meet Meta's aggressive 2030-2032 delivery timelines given licensing and construction uncertainties?

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
⚠️  CRITICAL: DATE WINDOW ENFORCEMENT (READ FIRST)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Before searching or including ANY item, calculate the exact date boundaries:

TODAY'S DATE: [Today's date]

CALCULATE THESE BOUNDARIES NOW:
• NEWS CUTOFF (72 hours):    [Today minus 3 days] — items MUST be dated ON OR AFTER this date
• PUBLICATION CUTOFF (7 days): [Today minus 7 days] — items MUST be dated ON OR AFTER this date

EXAMPLE: If today is January 20, 2026:
• News window: January 17-20, 2026 ONLY (nothing before Jan 17)
• Publications/Grantees window: January 13-20, 2026 ONLY (nothing before Jan 13)

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ MANDATORY PRE-INCLUSION CHECK FOR EVERY ITEM:                              │
│                                                                             │
│ 1. What is the EXACT publication/announcement date?                        │
│ 2. Is that date WITHIN the allowed window? (Calculate, don't estimate)     │
│ 3. If NO or UNCERTAIN → DO NOT INCLUDE. No exceptions.                     │
│                                                                             │
│ Items dated "January 2026" without a specific day = EXCLUDE                │
│ Items dated before the cutoff = EXCLUDE (even if highly relevant)          │
│ Items where you cannot verify the exact date = EXCLUDE                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:
✗ Including a "January 5" item when the news cutoff is January 17
✗ Including items dated "December 2025" in the news section
✗ Using vague dates like "January 2026" or "this month"
✗ Including older items because they're important or relevant
✗ Confusing the date an article was WRITTEN ABOUT something with when it HAPPENED

If an important event happened outside the window, you may REFERENCE it in a
summary of a newer item, but do NOT create a separate entry for it.

SEARCH QUERY TEMPLATES
---

These are starting points, not exhaustive lists. Expand searches as needed
to ensure comprehensive coverage. Use these patterns as a baseline, then
follow leads to related stories, filings, and announcements.

⚠️  CRITICAL: Always include SPECIFIC DATES in searches to filter results.
Use the EXACT date range for your window (e.g., "January 17 2026" OR
"January 18 2026" OR "January 19 2026" OR "January 20 2026" for a 72-hour
window ending January 20).

News & Statements (use specific dates, e.g., "January 18 2026"):
- "FERC" + "order" + [specific date]
- "transmission" + "project" + "approved" + [specific date]
- "renewable" + "PPA" + "announced" + [specific date]
- "offshore wind" + [company] + [specific date]
- "grid reliability" + [RTO] + [specific date]
- "permitting" + "reform" + [specific date]

Publications (use date range for past 7 days):
- site:eia.gov + "report" + [specific date range]
- site:nrel.gov + "publication" + [specific date range]
- site:rmi.org + [specific date range]
- site:rff.org + [specific date range]

Congressional Activity:
- site:congress.gov + "energy" + [specific date]
- "Senate" + "energy" + "hearing" + [specific date]
- "House" + "energy" + "markup" + [specific date]

Business Activity:
- [company from list] + "announces" + [specific date]
- "PPA" + "signed" + "MW" + [specific date]
- "data center" + "power" + "agreement" + [specific date]

AFTER EACH SEARCH: Verify the publication date on EVERY result before
considering it for inclusion. Search results often include older content.

---
COVERAGE GAPS TO NOTE
---

Always acknowledge in Limitations section if not accessible:
- Paywalled sources (S&P Global, Bloomberg Terminal)
- Real-time FERC filings
- Earnings call transcripts
- State PUC dockets
- International sources (IEA, IRENA)

---

For each section, actively search for news from these sources rather than relying on general searches.

---
SOURCE ACCURACY RULES (CRITICAL)
---

1. PRIMARY vs. SECONDARY SOURCES
   - Primary: Original reports, official announcements, filings, press releases
   - Secondary: News articles, commentary, analysis about primary sources
   - ALWAYS distinguish between them. Never present secondary coverage as the primary source.

2. DATING
   - Use the ORIGINAL publication date for reports/documents, not news coverage date
   - Example: If a Jan 15 article discusses a December report, use the December date
   - Format: "Report Name (December 2025)" not "Report Name · Jan 15, 2026"

3. ACCURATE TITLES
   - Title should reflect WHAT HAPPENED, not what the article is about
   - WRONG: "NPC Permitting Report" (when source is an article about company supporting the report)
   - RIGHT: "Williams Endorses NPC Permitting Report"

4. REACTIONS/COMMENTARY
   - Lead with WHO is reacting and WHAT they said
   - Reference the original source with its actual date
   - Example: "Williams CEO endorses NPC's December 2025 permitting report, calling for streamlined NEPA reviews"

5. VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY — ZERO TOLERANCE)

   ⚠️  THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE IN THIS PROMPT ⚠️

   Before including ANY item, you MUST complete this checklist:

   □ Step 1: Find the EXACT date (day, month, year) on the source
   □ Step 2: Calculate: Is [item date] ≥ [cutoff date]?
   □ Step 3: If YES and verified → include. If NO or UNCERTAIN → EXCLUDE.

   CUTOFF CALCULATION (do this math explicitly):
   • News cutoff = [Today's date] minus 3 days
   • Publication cutoff = [Today's date] minus 7 days

   EXCLUSION TRIGGERS (if ANY apply, do not include):
   ✗ Date is before the calculated cutoff
   ✗ Date cannot be verified from the source itself
   ✗ Date is vague (e.g., "January 2026" without specific day)
   ✗ Only the news coverage date is available, not the event date
   ✗ URL is inaccessible or content doesn't match

   WHAT TO DO INSTEAD:
   • If an older item provides important context → mention it briefly in a
     newer item's summary, but do NOT create a separate entry
   • If no items meet the date criteria for a section → write "Light news
     day for [topic]" rather than including stale content

   │ TIME WINDOW RULES (ABSOLUTE — NO EXCEPTIONS)                       │
   │                                                                     │
   │   News & Statements:     72 hours (3 days) — HARD CUTOFF           │

   │   An item dated January 5 CANNOT appear in a January 20 digest.    │
   │   An item dated December 18 CANNOT appear in a January 20 digest.  │
   │   "Relevance" and "importance" do NOT override date requirements.  │
   └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

6. LINK TO BEST SOURCE
   - Prefer linking to primary sources when available
   - If only secondary coverage exists, note that it's coverage of [original]

7. DEDUPLICATION
   - Avoid covering the same story in multiple sections
   - Pick the single most relevant section for each story
   - If a story spans multiple topics, choose the primary angle and mention secondary aspects in the summary

---
SECTIONS TO GENERATE
---

SECTION SIZE GUIDANCE:
- Target 3-6 items per section for balanced coverage
- Prioritize quality over quantity — include only genuinely significant items

EMPTY/LIGHT SECTION HANDLING (REQUIRED):
- If a section has 0 items within the time window: Include the section header
  followed by "No significant developments within the 72-hour window." (or 7-day
  for publications/grantees). Optionally note relevant recent context outside
  the window.
- If a section has only 1-2 marginal items: Note "Light news day for [topic]"
  rather than padding with low-significance stories.
- NEVER omit a required section entirely — always include the header with an
  explanation if empty.

1. Top Developments (3 bullet points summarizing biggest news)

2. News & Statements (past 72 hours ONLY — verify each date)
   ⚠️  Every item MUST have a verified date within the 72-hour window.
   If you cannot verify the date, DO NOT INCLUDE the item.

   ORGANIZE INTO SUBSECTIONS:
   - Federal Regulatory Action
   - Grid & Markets
   - Offshore Wind (if applicable)
   - Nuclear Developments (if applicable)
   - Other subsections as needed based on news

   Search: energy policy news, permitting reform, FERC orders, transmission projects, utility announcements, renewable energy, grid reliability, DOE announcements, offshore wind
   - Focus on NEW announcements, not coverage of older items
   - If covering reactions to older news, frame as reactions
   - ADD TOPIC TAGS to relevant items
   - EXCLUDE any item where the underlying event/announcement is outside 72 hours

3. Publications (past 7 days ONLY — verify each date)
   ⚠️  Every item MUST have a verified publication date within the 7-day window.
   Use the document's publication date, NOT the date you found it.

   Search: EIA, RMI, RFF, OECD, NREL, think tank reports, academic energy publications
   - Use actual publication date, not discovery date
   - If publication date cannot be verified, EXCLUDE the item

4. Congressional & Executive Activity
   Search: energy bills Congress, permitting reform legislation, FERC notices, Federal Register energy/environment, DOE announcements, EPA rules, BLM leasing
   - Include docket numbers and filing dates where available
   - If no activity within window: "No significant congressional or executive activity within the 72-hour window."

5. Business Activity (include MW, $, timelines)
   Search: energy project announcements, renewable PPAs, utility M&A, transmission projects, data center power deals, nuclear agreements
   - Distinguish between: announced, filed, approved, completed
   - ADD TOPIC TAGS to relevant items

6. China
   Search: China energy policy, State Grid, NDRC energy, China renewables, China carbon market, Five-Year Plan energy
   - If no China news within window: "No significant China energy developments within the 72-hour window." May note relevant background context.

7. Macro Trends (2-3 paragraphs)
   - Connect today's items to ongoing themes (permitting stalemate, data center load growth, nuclear momentum, etc.)
   - Cite specific items from this digest
   - Avoid speculation; stick to observable patterns

8. Market Context (optional — include if relevant to day's news)
   - Notable power price movements (if significant)
   - Natural gas price trends affecting generation economics
   - Only include if market moves help contextualize the day's stories

9. What to Watch This Week (table + Key Questions)
   - Table of upcoming deadlines, hearings, FERC meetings, court rulings, conferences
   - Verify dates against official calendars where possible

10. Grantee Activities (see detailed instructions below)

11. Limitations & Gaps
    - List sources not systematically covered
    - Note items where dates could not be verified
    - Note paywalled sources that limited coverage

SIGNIFICANCE SCORING
---

Assign a significance level to each NEWS, BUSINESS, and CONGRESSIONAL item:

**HIGH** — Assign when ANY of these apply:
- Scale: $1B+, 1GW+, affects 500,000+ customers
- Precedent: "first," "largest," "landmark," "historic," "unprecedented"
- Policy shift: Major FERC order, court ruling, legislation passed
- Market signal: Major company entering/exiting market, significant M&A
- Immediate impact: Project approved, begins operation, construction starts
- Cross-reference signal: Story appears in 3+ major sources (indicates broad importance)

**MEDIUM** — Assign when:
- Notable but not exceptional scale ($100M-$1B, 100MW-1GW)
- Incremental progress on known projects
- Regulatory filings or proposals (not final decisions)
- Industry reactions to major news
- Regional significance but not national

**LOW** — Assign when:
- Routine updates, minor project milestones
- Commentary or analysis without new information
- Local projects with limited broader implications
- Scheduled events occurring as expected

The Top Developments section should feature the 3 highest-significance items from the digest.

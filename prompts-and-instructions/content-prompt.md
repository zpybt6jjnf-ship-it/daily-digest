COVERAGE GAPS TO NOTE
---

Always acknowledge in Limitations section if not accessible:
- Paywalled sources (S&P Global, Bloomberg Terminal)
- Real-time FERC filings
- Earnings call transcripts
- State PUC dockets
- International sources (IEA, IRENA)

---

For each section, actively search for news from these sources rather than relying on general searches.

---
SOURCE ACCURACY RULES (CRITICAL)
---

1. PRIMARY vs. SECONDARY SOURCES
   - Primary: Original reports, official announcements, filings, press releases
   - Secondary: News articles, commentary, analysis about primary sources
   - ALWAYS distinguish between them. Never present secondary coverage as the primary source.

2. DATING
   - Use the ORIGINAL publication date for reports/documents, not news coverage date
   - Example: If a Jan 15 article discusses a December report, use the December date
   - Format: "Report Name (December 2025)" not "Report Name · Jan 15, 2026"

3. ACCURATE TITLES
   - Title should reflect WHAT HAPPENED, not what the article is about
   - WRONG: "NPC Permitting Report" (when source is an article about company supporting the report)
   - RIGHT: "Williams Endorses NPC Permitting Report"

4. REACTIONS/COMMENTARY
   - Lead with WHO is reacting and WHAT they said
   - Reference the original source with its actual date
   - Example: "Williams CEO endorses NPC's December 2025 permitting report, calling for streamlined NEPA reviews"

5. VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY)
   Before including ANY item, you MUST:
   - Confirm the source URL is accessible and contains the claimed content
   - Verify the publication date falls within the required time window:
     * News: past 24-48 hours
     * Publications: past 7 days
     * Grantee activities: past 7 days
   - If date cannot be confirmed from the source: mark "(date unconfirmed)"
   - If URL is inaccessible or content doesn't match summary: DO NOT INCLUDE the item
   - When source is paywalled: "(paywalled - summary based on available excerpt)"

   DO NOT guess or infer dates. If you cannot verify a date, either mark it
   as unconfirmed or exclude the item entirely.

6. LINK TO BEST SOURCE
   - Prefer linking to primary sources when available
   - If only secondary coverage exists, note that it's coverage of [original]

6. China
   Search: China energy policy, State Grid, NDRC energy, China renewables, China carbon market, Five-Year Plan energy

7. Macro Trends (2-3 paragraphs)
   - Connect today's items to ongoing themes (permitting stalemate, data center load growth, nuclear momentum, etc.)
   - Cite specific items from this digest
   - Avoid speculation; stick to observable patterns

8. What to Watch This Week (table + Key Questions)
   - Table of upcoming deadlines, hearings, FERC meetings, court rulings, conferences

SIGNIFICANCE SCORING
---

Assign a significance level to each NEWS, BUSINESS, and CONGRESSIONAL item:

**HIGH** — Assign when ANY of these apply:
- Scale: $1B+, 1GW+, affects 500,000+ customers
- Precedent: "first," "largest," "landmark," "historic," "unprecedented"
- Policy shift: Major FERC order, court ruling, legislation passed
- Market signal: Major company entering/exiting market, significant M&A
- Immediate impact: Project approved, begins operation, construction starts

**MEDIUM** — Assign when:
- Notable but not exceptional scale ($100M-$1B, 100MW-1GW)
- Incremental progress on known projects
- Regulatory filings or proposals (not final decisions)
- Industry reactions to major news
- Regional significance but not national

**LOW** — Assign when:
- Routine updates, minor project milestones
- Commentary or analysis without new information
- Local projects with limited broader implications
- Scheduled events occurring as expected

The Top Developments section should feature the 3 highest-significance items from the digest.

## Macro Trends

**Permitting Reform Stalemate**
SPEED Act passed House but Senate path unclear. CEQ's NEPA removal and offshore wind suspensions have polarized negotiations. NPC report and emergency auction proposal may create new pressure.

**Data Center Load Dominance**
Meta (6.6 GW nuclear), Google ($4.75B Intersect acquisition), and PJM auction data (49% of capacity costs) confirm hyperscalers as the defining force in generation investment. FERC's co-location order (compliance due today) addresses immediate rules but not cost allocation.

**Nuclear Momentum**
DOE's $2.7B enrichment commitment, FY26 appropriations ($3.1B), and Meta's deals represent aligned policy and commercial support. Supply chain and regulatory timelines are the binding constraints.

## What to Watch This Week

| Date | Event | Significance |
|:-----|:------|:-------------|
| Jan 20 | PJM compliance filing | Co-location rules could set precedent for other RTOs |
| Jan 20–24 | Vineyard Wind injunction | Last major project awaiting court decision |
| Jan 22 | FERC Open Meeting | Watch for transmission/rate case orders |
| Jan 22 | House E&C hearing | Energy witnesses before E&C and Ways & Means |
| Jan 30 | CR deadline | 6 of 12 appropriations bills passed |

**Key Questions**

1. Will PJM's filing satisfy FERC or trigger further proceedings?
2. Does Vineyard Wind secure injunctive relief, completing the 5-for-5 sweep?
3. Any movement on bipartisan permitting negotiations given legal setbacks for administration?
